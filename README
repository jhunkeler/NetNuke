BUGS
----

- SATA devices are not supported on BSD until code can be implemented to fix 
a device iteration failure.  /dev/ad0 is the start of IDE.  /dev/ad4 is the 
start of SATA.  Linux should remain OK.

- If a SCSI bus failure occurs, NetNuke does not know to skip its current
device (yet).


OPERATING SYSTEMS SUPPORTED
---------------------------

BSD:
	FreeBSD - Works
	OpenBSD - Not Tested, and will not work yet.
	NetBSD  - Not Tested, and will not work yet.

Linux:
	2.4 - Not Tested, and may not work
	2.6 - Works, but needs more testing


OPTION REFERENCE
----------------

--help
			Display NetNuke application options, and exit.



--write-mode [s] or -w [s]:	
	Accepts a 32-bit integer value.
      0: Synchronous
						Data is immediately committed to the disk.

			1: Asynchronous
						Data is buffered, and is committed to the disk over time. (Very fast)

			Default: 0

--nuke-level [n] or -nl [n]
	Accepts a 32-bit integer value.
  		0: Zero out
				 - Write zeros across all devices.

      1: Static patterns
				 - One of the 24 patterns are selected per device (or per write pass).
					 
					 Pattern table is as follows:
							0xA0, 0xB0, 0xC0, 0xD0, 0xE0, 0xF0,
							0xA1, 0xB1, 0xC1, 0xD1, 0xE1, 0xF1,
							0xA2, 0xB2, 0xC2, 0xD2, 0xE2, 0xF2,
							0xA3, 0xB3, 0xC3, 0xD3, 0xE3, 0xF3
					 
      2: Fast random 
				 - A random buffer is generated, and the data is written across all
					 devices.

      3: Slow random (regenerate random buffer)
				 - A random buffer is regenerated every 128 completed write operations.

      4: Ultra-slow re-writing method
				 - NOT IMPLEMENTED (defaults to static pattern method)

			Default: 1

--passes [n] or -p [n]
	Accepts a 32-bit integer value.
			This options defines the number of full passes NetNuke should perform on
			a single device during its operation.  
			Default: 1



--disable-test
	USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!
			Test-mode is disabled, and all write operations are allowed to begin.
			Default: NetNuke writes all test iterations to /dev/null



--block-size [n] or -b [n]
	Accepts a 32-bit integer value.
			This option defines the number of device blocks NetNuke should attempt 
			to wipe. 
			Default: 512



--verbose or -v
	Enables verbose messages
	Default: off


--verbose-high or -vv
	Enables a high degree of verbose messages.  The output will obstruct any usable
	human-readable data, as well as cause the write operation to slow down to a
	crawl.  
	Default: off

--version or -V
	Display NetNuke's version and license, then exit.
